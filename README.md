# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Web App

This is a simple **Machine Learning Web Application** that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical input data.  
It uses a trained ML model and a **Streamlit** web interface for user interaction.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Model Type:** Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)
- **Framework:** Streamlit
- **Libraries Used:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Pickle
- **Language:** Python

The user provides health data such as glucose level, BMI, insulin level, etc., and the app predicts if the person is likely to have diabetes.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The ML model (trained using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset) is loaded with `pickle`.
2. The user inputs health parameters through a Streamlit web form.
3. The app preprocesses the data and makes a prediction.
4. The result is displayed instantly.
